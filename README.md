# Metamaterial-Integrated-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna-for-Enhanced-Near-Field-Material-Detection

This thesis focuses on the design and development of a metamaterial-integrated
microstrip patch antenna intended for the non-invasive characterization of materials
placed near its surface. The primary objective is to achieve a highly sensitive antenna
structure capable of detecting small variations in material properties, particularly
for materials of very small size, by observing changes in the antenna’s S-parameters,
resonant frequency, and bandwidth. Multiple antenna designs were modeled and
analyzed using simulation tools and one of the most promising configurations was
fabricated for experimental testing. The fabricated antenna was subjected to a range
of test materials to evaluate its response, with detailed measurements recorded under
controlled conditions.
Using the properties of the metamaterial, the antenna exhibited an enhanced
electromagnetic interaction with nearby materials, thus improving its sensitivity.
The data collected were analyzed to assess material characteristics such as
dielectric nature, conductivity, and classification into metallic or nonmetallic
categories. Furthermore, when unknown samples were introduced, their
electromagnetic response was compared with previously obtained data to infer
potential material properties, highlighting the antenna’s capability as a reusable
and reference-based sensor.
